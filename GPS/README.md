#GPS Code

 * **uBx** main code folder for GPS chipsets, for now it only emulates u-Centre comms capacity. It supersedes TinyGPS-13 code, which was intended for different chip.
 * **Serial** introductory code for dual communication. Intended as starting point for GPS corrections support or nav payload relay.
